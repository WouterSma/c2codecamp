    <p>Is this the real life?<br>
        Is this just fantasy?<br>
        Caught in a landside,<br>
        No escape from reality<br>
        Open your eyes,<br>
        Look up to the skies and see,<br>
        I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,<br>
        Because I'm easy come, easy go,<br>
        Little high, little low,<br>
        Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to<br>
        Me, to me<br>
        Mamaaa,<br>
        Just killed a man,<br>
        Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,<br>
        Now he's dead<br>
        Mamaaa, life had just begun,<br>
        But now I've gone and thrown it all away<br>
        Mama, oooh,<br>
        Didn't mean to make you cry,<br>
        If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,<br>
        Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters<br>
        Too late, my time has come,<br>
        Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all<br>
        The time<br>
        Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,<br>
        Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth<br>
        Mama, oooh<br>
        I don't want to die,<br>
        I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.<br>
        I see a little silhouetto of a man,<br>
        Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango!<br>
        Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me<br>
        Galileo, Galileo<br>
        Galileo, Galileov
        Galileo, Figaro - magnificoov
        I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me<br>
        He's just a poor boy from a poor family,<br>
        Spare him his life from this monstrosity<br>
        Easy come, easy go, will you let me go<br>
        Bismillah! No, we will not let you go<br>
        (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go<br>
        (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go<br>
        (Let me go) Will not let you go<br>
        (Let me go)(Never) Never let you go<br>
        (Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah<br>
        No, no, no, no, no, no, no<br>
        Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go<br>
        Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me,<br>
        For meee<br>
        So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye<br>
        So you think you can love me and leave me to die<br>
        Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,<br>
        Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here<br>
        Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,<br>
        Nothing really matters,<br>
        Nothing really matters to me<br>
        Any way the wind blows...<br>
