                I, I can't get these memories out of my mind<br>
                And some kind of madness has started to evolve<br>
                I, I tried so hard to let you go<br>
                But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah<br>
                I have finally seen the light<br>
                And I have finally realized<br>
                What you mean<br>
                Oh oh oh<br>
                And now, I need to know is this real love<br>
                Or is it just madness keeping us afloat?<br>
                And when I look back at all the crazy fights we had<br>
                Like some kind of madness<br>
                Was taking control<br>
                Yeah<br>
                And now I have finally seen the light<br>
                And I have finally realized<br>
                What you need<br>
                Mm<br>
                But now I have finally seen the end (finally seen the end)<br>
                And I'm not expecting you to care (expecting you to care)<br>
                That I have finally seen the light (finally seen the light)<br>
                I have finally realized (realized)<br>
                I need to love<br>
                I need to love<br>
                Come to mev
                Trust in a dream<br>
                Come on and rescue me<br>
                Yes I know, I can be wrong<br>
                And maybe I'm too headstrong<br>
                Our love is<br>
                Madness<br>
