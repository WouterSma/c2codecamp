                Paranoia is in bloom<br>
                The PR transmissions will resume<br>
                They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down<br>
                And hope that we will never see the truth around<br>
                (So come on)<br>
                Another promise, another scene<br>
                Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed<br>
                And all the green belts wrapped around our minds<br>
                And endless red tape to keep the truth confined<br>
                (So come on)<br>
                They will not force us<br>
                They will stop degrading us<br>
                They will not control us<br>
                We will be victorious<br>
                (So come on)<br>
                Interchanging mind control<br>
                Come, let the revolution take its toll<br>
                If you could flick the switch and open your third eye<br>
                You'd see that we should never be afraid to die<br>
                (So come on)<br>
                Rise up and take the power back<br>
                It's time the fat cats had a heart attack<br>
                You know that their time's coming to an end<br>
                We have to unify and watch our flag ascend<br>
                (So come on)<br>
                They will not force us<br>
                They will stop degrading us<br>
                They will not control us<br>
                We will be victorious<br>
                (So come on)<br>
                They will not force us<br>
                They will stop degrading us<br>
                They will not control us<br>
                We will be victorious<br>
                (So come on)<br>
